Project 1:
Make buying life insurance easier.

Challenge:
In a one-click shopping world with on-demand everything, the life insurance application process is antiquated(outdated). 
Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, 
a process that takes an average of 30 days.

The result? People are turned off. Thatâ€™s why only 40% of U.S. households own individual life insurance.

Xyz company wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries.

By developing a predictive model that accurately classifies risk using a more automated approach, you can greatly impact public perception of the industry.
